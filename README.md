# slowRoot

These are 2 algorithms that I've created that aim to find the square root of any
number.

# The first one (slowRoot_slow)

This one just keeps on incrementing a number by a small amount until
it reaches the square root.

# The second one (slowRoot_superSlow)

The second one creates a list of a lot of numbers.
It then randomly choses a number from the list until
it reaches square root.
